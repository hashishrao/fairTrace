# **App Name**: FairTrace

## Core Features:

- Content Feed: Display a feed of community content with posts ranked by the current algorithm.
- Transparent Scoring: Show the current algorithm's scoring for each post (e.g., factors contributing to its ranking).
- Algorithm Modification Proposals: Allow users to propose modifications to the algorithm (e.g., weight changes for ranking factors).
- Community Voting: Implement a voting mechanism for users to collectively decide on algorithm modifications.
- Impact Analysis: AI tool to analyze the impact of proposed algorithm modifications, predicting their effect on content ranking and diversity. Generative AI predicts outcomes of proposed modification
    - Suggest new weight combinations that improve fairness or engagement using ML models
- Algorithm Versioning: Display the version history of the content ranking algorithm.
- Content Submission: A user-friendly interface for content creation and submission, enabling users to easily share their contributions to the community feed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#2E9AFE) for trust and transparency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to ensure content readability.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF851B) to highlight key actions like voting and algorithm proposals.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, readable interface.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent ranking factors, voting, and algorithm modifications.
- Clear separation of content feed, scoring information, and algorithm modification interface.
- Subtle animations for voting actions and algorithm updates to provide feedback without being distracting.
