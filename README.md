## 🧠 About the Project

**FairTrace** is a decentralized platform enabling **transparent governance** of algorithms used in content ranking and recommendation. It empowers users to:

- 🔍 View exactly **why a post ranks** the way it does
- 🧪 Run **A/B tests** on algorithm variants
- 🧮 Use a **score calculator** before posting
- 💬 Participate in governance via **proposals and community votes**
- 🤖 Explore **AI-assisted scoring suggestions** for fairness and engagement

It's your algorithm — not the platform's black box.
